# Project Overview
The project implemented an autonomous agent for Geister (a game with partially observable 
information [Geister rules](https://ghosts-challenge.math.unipd.it/rules/game)) in Matlab
It uses 1-population competition co-evolutionary algorithm as main flow. Both internal
fitness and external fitness are assessed through competing with each other and competing with
the author.

# instruction
Use 'Main.m' to start the program. It goes through the whole process from training to getting
the final model.
